This code attempts to use the `Monad` instance for `Maybe` to sequence a list of potentially failing computations.  The problem lies in the way `sequence` interacts with potentially empty lists. When the input list is empty, `sequence` will return `Just []`, representing the successful completion of zero actions. However, the intended behavior might be to handle an empty list as a kind of failure.
