This corrected version explicitly handles the empty list case to return `Nothing` when the input list is empty, representing the failure scenario. It uses pattern matching to check for the empty list condition and then explicitly returns `Nothing`.

```haskell
sequenceMaybe :: [Maybe a] -> Maybe [a]
sequenceMaybe [] = Nothing
sequenceMaybe (x:xs) = do
  x' <- x
  xs' <- sequenceMaybe xs
  return (x' : xs')
```
This approach provides a more predictable behavior when dealing with potentially empty lists of Maybe values.
